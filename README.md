Project
Overview
Summary


Our goal is to create a scheduling application for restaurants to keep track of their budget and create goals to maximize profitability. It will also provide the employees with a convenient and thorough application to view their schedules, view the team they will be working with, and swap shifts. 


Our scheduling program will be designed for Business/Restaurants. There will be two views, manager and employee. The manager inputs three types of parameters to keep the business profitable: fixed costs, variable costs, and goals (e.g. schedule to not exceed 25% of variable costs). The employees can input their availability. The program will generate the maximum number of hours to put on the schedule to keep on budget and give suggestions for scheduling based on employees' availability. Employees will be able to view their schedules and efficiently swap shifts. They will also have access to their coworkers contact information to help coordinate coverage/shift swaps/call outs with each other before involving upper management. Total hours worked will be displayed for each employee for payroll purposes. It can be adjusted for an hourly export for temporary workers or a weekly, biweekly, or bimonthly export.

Many scheduling applications currently in use within the quick-service restaurant industry have a number of shortcomings, namely a lack of budgeting tools or not allowing employees access to enough information regarding their shift. Controlling payroll costs is the easiest way for restaurants to increase profitability while creating an efficient schedule that has just the right amount of resources available in each position is the easiest and most effective way to control payroll costs. Having excess employees on schedule not only increases payroll costs, but also decreases productivity. It may seem counterintuitive, but when excess resources are assigned to a task, employees might spend time needlessly socializing, waiting for their coworkers or management to accomplish a task for them, or simply create a lack of space in the kitchen due to crowding. Not scheduling enough employees compromises the customer experience, places undue stress on active employees, potentially leads to retention issues, and may even decrease the potential sales of the restaurant. This is because the restaurant could be forced to turn away customers, make certain items or sections of the restaurant unavailable, or turn off third party delivery services. The balance between having enough people on schedule in every position and not having excess is difficult to find, but can improve the profitability of a business. Most managers do not have the time or resources to create an optimal schedule. Our goal is to help solve this problem.
